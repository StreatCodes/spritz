## Spritz

A simple tool written in go to locate the individual sprites in a sprite sheet. The sprite sheet must be in the same directory as the application when ran and be named `sheet.png`. Currently the tool will only map images that have a transparent background.

The code is very simple, and there are comments if you wish to modify/improve it for your own purposes.
